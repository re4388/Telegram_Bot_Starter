# Telegram Bot

## functionalities, so far
- A local server, I use this express server to send message when request hit the endpoint
- Every morning, the scheduler will send request to express server and telegram bot will report weather status to me
- A Bot listener, so when user enter whatever word, bot will send the current weather status


## Next step
- put long running job and service on the cloud.
